Among the four given algorithms the WQUPC (Weight quick union path compression) is the efficient algorithm.And the are the following reasons:

1.It has less time-complexity and its formula is M + N log * N
where M is number of operations and N is number of objects.

2.Using this algorithm we can be execute any problem in less time.

3.Array access in this algorithm is done less number of times.
